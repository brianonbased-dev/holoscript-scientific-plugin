## How This Works

This file is the **single source of truth** for strategic decisions. All AI agents read this before starting work to:
- Avoid asking questions you already answered
- Understand current constraints and priorities
- Know what work is pre-approved (autonomous) vs needs approval

**Update frequency**: After each decision sprint (3x daily: 9-10am, 12-1pm, 5-5:30pm)

## Current Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]

### Strategic Decisions (Binding)

**✅ APPROVED:** [Decision description]
- **Rationale**: [Why this decision]
- **AI Autonomy**: [Full | Partial | None - explain]
- **Deadline**: [Date if applicable]
- **Decision ID**: #[number]
- **Related**: [Links to issues, PRs, docs]

**❌ REJECTED:** [Decision description]
- **Rationale**: [Why rejected]
- **Revisit when**: [Conditions or date]
- **Decision ID**: #[number]

**⏸️ DEFERRED:** [Decision description]
- **Rationale**: [Why not now]
- **Revisit**: [Sprint number or date]
- **Decision ID**: #[number]

### Current Constraints (Always Apply)

**Hard Deadlines:**
- [Deadline 1] - [What must ship]
- [Deadline 2] - [What must ship]

**Strategic Priorities (Ranked):**
1. [Top priority - focus here]
2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority]

**Technical Constraints:**
- [e.g., "No new dependencies without approval"]
- [e.g., "All changes must pass quality gates"]
- [e.g., "Maintain backward compatibility"]

**Resource Constraints:**
- [e.g., "API rate limits: 1000 req/min"]
- [e.g., "Database size <10GB"]

---

### AI Autonomous Work (Pre-Approved)

**Full Autonomy** (AI can execute without asking):
- [Type of work 1] - Example: "Implement OAuth2 flows"
- [Type of work 2] - Example: "Write unit tests for existing code"
- [Type of work 3] - Example: "Update documentation"
- [Type of work 4] - Example: "Refactor for readability (no logic changes)"

**Conditions:**
- All tests must pass
- Quality gates must pass
- Create PR for review (don't merge automatically)

---

### AI Blocked Work (Needs Approval)

**Always ask Josep first:**
- Architecture changes (new services, major refactors)
- External API integrations (security review needed)
- Database schema changes (migration risk)
- Breaking changes to public API
- New dependencies or libraries
- Production deployments
- Changes affecting >1000 lines of code

### Open Questions for Next Decision Sprint

**Questions for Josep:**
1. [Question 1]
2. [Question 2]
3. [Question 3]

**AI to research before asking:**
- [Topic to investigate]
- [Alternative to evaluate]

## Decision History

### [Previous Date]

**✅ APPROVED:** [Decision]
- Outcome: [What happened after implementation]
- Impact: [Business/technical impact]

[Keep last 2-3 weeks of history, archive older]

## Decision Templates

### Template: Add CRUD Endpoint
**Auto-approved if:**
- Standard REST patterns (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Database table already exists
- Similar endpoints exist as reference
- No custom business logic needed

**Example approved:** "Add CRUD for User Profile endpoint"

### Template: Bug Fix
**Auto-approved if:**
- Bug is confirmed (reproducible)
- Fix is <100 lines of code
- Tests added to prevent regression
- No architecture changes

**Example approved:** "Fix null pointer exception in auth flow"

### Template: Refactoring
**Needs approval if:**
- Changes affect >500 lines
- Changes public API surface
- Performance implications unclear

**Auto-approved if:**
- Rename variables/functions for clarity
- Extract functions to reduce complexity
- Add comments/documentation
